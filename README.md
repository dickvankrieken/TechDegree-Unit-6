# TechDegree-Unit-6

For this project I had to write the Javascript programming for a Wheel of Success game show app. A random phrase is chosen and the player has to guess the phrase by chosing letters on the displayed keyboard. 

I am going for an exceeds expectations grade and therefore I have added CSS transitions for when a chosen letter matches and is displayed on the screen. I have also added 'play again' buttons to the win and lose screens which allow the players to start the game again. This resets the game.
